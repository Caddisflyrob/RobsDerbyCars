               I have been involved with making pinewood derby cars for most of my life.
            I built my first car, with the help of my dad, in 1974 as a six year old
            Cub Scout in Fort Devens, MA. My first car, “The Pinewood Derby Monster”,
            ended up winning second place in the entire state of Massachusetts for the car show
            competition. I continued to make cars each year until 1980 when I moved to Montana
            and left scouting. In 1995, while stationed at Offutt Air Force Base, I was
            called into the ministry to become a commander in the Royal Rangers, with Outpost
            28 at Bellevue Christian Center in Bellevue, Nebraska. As with the Boy Scouts,
            the annual Pinewood Derby is a popular activity with the Royal Rangers also.
            I was excited to get back into designing and building creative cars, this time as
            an adult. The first car I built as a Royal Ranger Commander, “Gone Fishin’”, won
            first place in show in the Adult division at the Nebraska district Winter Powwow.
            I have been making unique cars almost every year since I became a Royal Ranger
            Leader.  I am currently the Senior Royal Ranger Commander at Outpost 22 at Berean
            Assembly of God in Springfield, Oregon. Each year, I not only make my own car,
            but assist, my two children, my wife, and the boys in my outpost, in making their
            own cars. As you can see by the detail put into each of my creations, I have a great
            deal of fun with Pinewood Derby. I hope this web site will spark in you a similar
            passion and enthusiasm for pinewood derby as I have.
